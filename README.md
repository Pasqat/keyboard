# Programmer Dvorak modified

My personal layout of the programmer Dvorak with number remapped into their classic position

(123456789 instead 7531902468)

Also remapped the bracket to open one with the left hand and close with the same finger of the right hand.
This logic came from the personal Dvorak layout of [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards). Because I don't have a Kynesis keyboard have made my.



## Note

The image refer to Windows, especially the **Altgr** version. This indeed lack in the Linux version where is the compose key (key 102 the key between Lshift and Z in a QWERTY layout).

To have letters such as `à ò è ù ì` in Linux use the sequence 

`compose key + theLetterYouWant`
